### Introduction to Load Balancers in AWS EKS

In modern cloud-native architectures, **Load Balancers** play a crucial role in ensuring **high availability**, **scalability**, and **resilience** of applications. They distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend resources, such as EC2 instances or Kubernetes pods, ensuring the application's reliability and performance.

When deploying applications on **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**, integrating Load Balancers becomes essential for managing external traffic and facilitating communication between application components. AWS offers three primary types of load balancers, each designed to cater to specific use cases and protocols:

---

#### 1. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**  
- **Protocols Supported**: TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, and SSL.  
- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - A legacy option designed for basic load balancing needs.  
  - Supports both EC2-Classic and VPC environments.  
  - Simplistic in functionality and not recommended for modern applications.  
- **Kubernetes Context**:  
  - When a Kubernetes `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` is created in EKS, the default Load Balancer provisioned by AWS is the Classic Load Balancer (unless specified otherwise).  
  - As CLB is considered **deprecated**, it’s advisable to use **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** or **Network Load Balancers (NLB)** for new deployments.

---

#### 2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**  
- **Protocols Supported**: HTTP, HTTPS.  
- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - Ideal for modern web applications.  
  - Operates at the **Application Layer (Layer 7)** of the OSI model, enabling features like host-based and path-based routing.  
  - Provides enhanced security through HTTPS and SSL termination.  
  - Well-suited for microservices architectures deployed on Kubernetes.  

- **Kubernetes Context**:  
  - The **AWS ALB Ingress Controller** is commonly used to manage ALBs in EKS.  
  - It allows advanced routing configurations, such as port 80 to 443 redirection, path-based routing, and SSL termination.  

---

#### 3. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**  
- **Protocols Supported**: TCP, UDP, TLS.  
- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - Operates at the **Transport Layer (Layer 4)** of the OSI model.  
  - Designed for handling high-throughput, low-latency traffic.  
  - Ideal for applications requiring raw network-level access.  

- **Kubernetes Context**:  
  - The Kubernetes `Service` of type `LoadBalancer` can also be configured to create an NLB instead of the default CLB.  
  - Frequently used for applications needing consistent low-latency performance.

### Load Balancers and AWS EKS

In AWS EKS, Load Balancers bridge the gap between external users and the applications running inside your Kubernetes cluster. Here’s how they integrate into the Kubernetes ecosystem:  

- **Service of Type LoadBalancer**:  
  When a Kubernetes `Service` is defined with the `LoadBalancer` type, AWS automatically provisions a Load Balancer. By default, a Classic Load Balancer is created unless specified to use an ALB or NLB.  
  - Traffic flows from the Load Balancer to the worker nodes hosting the application pods.  

- **Ingress Controllers**:  
  For advanced traffic management, **Ingress Controllers** like the **AWS ALB Ingress Controller** or **AWS Load Balancer Controller** are used. These controllers enable routing based on specific rules, such as hostnames and paths, and are integrated with ALBs for Layer 7 routing.

### Transition to Modern Load Balancers

AWS is moving away from Classic Load Balancers, encouraging the adoption of ALBs and NLBs for their advanced features and better integration with Kubernetes. While the CLB may still be available for legacy workloads, using ALBs and NLBs is the recommended practice for production-grade Kubernetes deployments.

In the upcoming sections, we’ll explore the step-by-step implementation of each Load Balancer type with Kubernetes on AWS EKS, starting with the Classic Load Balancer. We’ll also delve into private and public node groups, VPC configurations, and connecting workloads to external databases via secure and efficient traffic routing mechanisms.
