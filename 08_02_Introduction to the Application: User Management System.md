### Introduction to the Application: User Management System

In this section, we will build and deploy a **User Management System**, a sample application that demonstrates how to use a **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** in an AWS EKS cluster to ensure high availability and seamless traffic distribution. This application will serve as a practical example to understand the architecture and functionality of a CLB in a Kubernetes environment.

#### **Overview of the Application**

The User Management System is a simple web-based application designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data. It interacts with a backend database for storing and retrieving user information. The application architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Frontend**: A simple UI for managing users.
2. **Backend**: A RESTful API service to process requests from the frontend.
3. **Database**: A MySQL RDS instance to store user data.

---

#### **Application Features**
- **User Management**:
  - Add, update, and delete users.
  - Fetch user information.
- **Database Connectivity**:
  - Secure communication with an Amazon RDS MySQL database.
- **High Availability**:
  - Requests will be distributed across multiple application pods using the **Classic Load Balancer**.
- **Scalability**:
  - The application is designed to scale dynamically as traffic increases.

#### **Why Use the Classic Load Balancer?**
The Classic Load Balancer serves as the entry point for incoming requests to the User Management System. Although considered a legacy option, it helps us understand:
- The basics of integrating a load balancer with a Kubernetes cluster.
- Traffic distribution across multiple application pods.
- Communication between the application and the database.

By leveraging the Classic Load Balancer, this lecture will highlight the foundational concepts of load balancing in AWS EKS before transitioning to more advanced solutions like the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** or the **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** in subsequent lectures.

#### **Application Deployment Architecture**
The architecture of the User Management System is designed to demonstrate a real-world scenario. Here's a high-level overview:
1. **EKS Cluster**: The application will run on worker nodes provisioned in private subnets for enhanced security.
2. **Classic Load Balancer**: A CLB will be deployed in the public subnet to route external traffic to the backend pods in the EKS cluster.
3. **Database Layer**: An RDS instance will be deployed in a private subnet, accessible only through an external name service configured in Kubernetes.
4. **NAT Gateway**: Used to enable the worker nodes in the private subnet to communicate with the EKS control plane API and other external services.

---

#### **Traffic Flow**
1. End-users will access the application using the DNS URL of the Classic Load Balancer.
2. The Classic Load Balancer will forward requests to one of the backend pods running in the EKS cluster.
3. The backend pods will use an external name service to interact securely with the RDS database.
4. Responses will follow the reverse path, ensuring a seamless user experience.

---

#### **Outcome**
By the end of this lecture, you will:
- Understand how to integrate a Classic Load Balancer with a Kubernetes application.
- Learn to configure and manage traffic between end-users, application pods, and backend databases.
- Be equipped with foundational knowledge to explore advanced AWS Load Balancers in subsequent lectures.
