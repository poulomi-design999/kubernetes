Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a crucial system for managing access within a Kubernetes cluster, especially when multiple team members require varying levels of security from each other. RBAC in Kubernetes serves to restrict and define access permissions within the cluster.

In general, RBAC operates by associating roles with specific verbs (e.g., get, list) and nouns (e.g., pods, volumes), essentially determining what actions can be performed on Kubernetes objects. Kubernetes offers predefined roles, and users can also create custom roles using YAML files. However, it's essential to note that a role alone doesn't grant any permissions. To enable access, a role must be bound to a specific user or entity through role bindings.

Role bindings establish the connection between a role and the entity authorized to execute API calls, effectively mapping permissions. Users can have multiple roles, and often, roles are associated with groups via role bindings.

It's important to distinguish between two types of resources in Kubernetes:

1. **Namespace-based resources:** These resources are confined within a specific namespace, serving as the scope for resource control.

2. **Cluster-level resources:** These resources operate at the overall cluster level.

There are two primary types of role bindings:

1. **Cluster Role Bindings:** These provide access at the cluster level, affecting resources across all namespaces.

2. **Role Bindings:** These grant access at the namespace level, influencing resources within a specific namespace.

In summary, RBAC in Kubernetes revolves around defining roles that specify what actions can be taken on resources, and these roles are then bound to entities through role bindings to grant the necessary permissions.
